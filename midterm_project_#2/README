## Assignment
#####

Determine whether the microbiomes of a person with attributes o, p or q is associated with symptoms x, y or z.

1. Construct a metadata table for your samples.
2. Combine your data into one single file and compute kmer-otu clustering.
3. Split the kmer-otu result into separate data sets
4. Count the otu numbers separately for each set, then combine the otu counts for each set into an otu table.
5. Compute PCoA analysis for your datasets.
6. Compute PCA analysis for your datasets.
7. Use color and symbol sets for your graphic presentation.
8. Include a conclusion statement in your report, addressing:
	a. If your opq, xyz factors can be distinguished by your microbiome data.
	b. If your analysis revealed any of the OTUs that can distinguish among your samples, opq factors, xyz factors, or sampling sites A and B.
9. Add any additional comments on what you uncovered during your analysis.
